# InfoTech 1000 Midterm Project
**Objective**: The goal of this project is to provide experience writing with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), a text format that easily transfers to HTML while also providing experience working on [Github](https://github.com/).

After creating and completing our project we are expected to submit an HTTPS URL that links to our Github repository.

**This Repository's Description**: The main page of this repository is housed on the _README.md_, the current page. This page however is only one of five total markdown pages. This repository also houses four other pages titled as follows.
- [Markdown1](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown1.md)
- [Markdown2](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown2.md)
- [Markdown3](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown3.md)
- [Markdown4](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown4.md)

Each of the above markdown pages fits all of the above listed criteria while also varying from one another slightly based on the information written in each.

**Project Description**: By using Markdown, we are expected to create a repository on Github that houses multiple text pages. Each of the five pages is to be different from another while also fitting multiple requirements. Each page is expected to fit the following criteria and include each of the below listed aspects.
- Paragraphs
- Headers
- Links to each markdown page (Like below)
- Links to external websites (Like above)
- One or more images hosted on the Github repo such as:

- One or more images from elsewhere on the web such as:

- A list (Like this one)
- Bolded text (Like **This**)
- Italicized text (Like _This_)
- A block of code
Such as:
```
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello World<h1>
</body>
</html>
```
