# Focusing on the Coding side of things

One of the main focuses in the Mizzou IT degree is software development and computer management. This focuses typically emphasizes the [coding](https://grasshopper.app/why-coding/) aspect of computers, my favorite. Through this focus we learn about how code can be used to manipulate data, create a website, design an app, and much more. There are hundreds of coding languages out there but some of the languages we focus on include
- Python
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Swift
- And more!

Although this is my favorite aspect of the degree so far, it's not everybody's. The degree also focuses on digital media design which is discussed more in [Markdown3](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown3.md).

Below I included some examples of what a small **Python** coding project looks like along with what a class assignment looks like.
```
  import math

  print ('This program is designed to output the volume of a cylinder based off '
        'of user inputs! To do this, a height and radius is required.')
  Height = float(input('Please provide a height for the cylinder: '))
  Radius = float(input('Please provide a radius for the base of the cylinder: '))

  Rsqr = Radius * Radius
  Volume = math.pi * Height * Rsqr

  print('The volume of your cylinder is ' , Volume)
```

This project simply asks for an imput from the user and calculates the volume of a cylinder with the provided parameters. Below I included the original assignment so you can see what we as a student recieve and learn from.
