The other main focus of the IT degree at Mizzou is studying and learning the design process behind digital media. How to develop an idea, design it, and produce it into its highest quality. These designs are typically made to support the code behind them (discussed in [Markdown2](https://github.com/jakesimpkins/midtermProject/blob/main/markdown2.md) and build a presentable **front end** Some of the possible uses of this include:

- Web development
- Game graphics
- Game sound
- and more!

Most of the design processes are done through [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html?sdid=KKQWX&mv=search&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwhsmaBhCvARIsAIbEbH7YoZJDwxAM9l9ODIOPxfPMC3d7D4xm6E9Nhh0kxr9Cth5X1c6lYEAaAh14EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!3085!3!541671698376!e!!g!!adobe!50818900!3060803800&mv=search&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhsmaBhCvARIsAIbEbH7YoZJDwxAM9l9ODIOPxfPMC3d7D4xm6E9Nhh0kxr9Cth5X1c6lYEAaAh14EALw_wcB) and the design tools _Adobe_ offers such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Audition. Below I included an example of an SVG we created in class to show some of the work we do.

Although we focus on design, code can still be used to create these elements. Coding languages like CSS specialize in creating graphics on the front end of websites. Below I included a block of code that creates an SVG of a red circle using HTML.

```
<svg height="100" width="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```
